# Assumption Engine™

**Now in GAMMA!**

This is a poorly-documented "Assumption Engine." It's really good at making assumptions. Honest.

You'll probably be most interested in `assumptions.json`, but feel free to take a peek at the whole bit.

Want a demo? See it [in action on my site](http://erik.vorh.es/assumes/).

You know that the ™ is a joke, right?
